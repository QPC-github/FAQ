# Does RGB require Taproot?

Overall RGB doesn't need Taproot to function. RGB can work on Lightning without it, but the point is that many things can be done in a more efficient way when Taproot is there. And there is no reason of first doing a version of RGB without Taproot, and then with it \(Taproot is nearly released anyway\).
