# What does 'RGB' stand for?

Originally, the name RGB was chosen because the project started as a "better version of [Colored Coins](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins)". Then, already during the few weeks into the research work with Peter Todd, in 2018, it diverged so much that it has nothing to do anymore with Colored Coins. But the name stuck.  
  
Also, it stands for "Really Good for Bitcoin' ðŸ˜Ž
