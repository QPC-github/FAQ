# Is it possible to create a DAO with RGB?

Yes. Actually, you can create a DAO with Bitcoin, not even with RGB.   
When we have [Taproot](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/taproot/), you can create a DAO with particular voting rights \(whatever they are\), structure it as tapscript, assign digital assets/company rights to an output and have a proper DAO-like structure of arbitrary complexity on top of Bitcoin.
