# What is client-side validation?

**Client-side validation** - is one of the core paradigms used in RGB, which states, that all the data is kept outside of bitcoin transactions, i.e. bitcoin blockchain or lightning channel state. This allows the system to operate on top of Lightning Network without any changes to the LN protocols and also gives a foundation for a high level of protocol scalability and privacy.
