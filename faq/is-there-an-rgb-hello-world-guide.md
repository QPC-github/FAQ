# Is there an RGB "Hello World" guide?

At this moment you can play around with RGB either using a CLI+RGB Node or using Bitcoin Pro \(both through CLI or as a UI on your desktop\). [ Here you can see](https://www.rgbfaq.com/community/getting-familiar-with-rgb) many links with demos.   
For example these ones:   
- [RGB Beta Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_EtUf4601A&t=4s&ab_channel=LNPBPStandardsAssociation)  
- [Bitcoin Pro demo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6aOZYXJo-99Mx-RTkmw3o5wA7PW_gQl)   
  
Corresponding repositories are mentioned in the videos and the descriptions of them:   
- [Bitcoin Pro](https://github.com/pandoracore/bitcoin-pro)   
- [RGB Node](https://github.com/rgb-org/rgb-node/tree/master/doc/demo-0.1)  
  
_NB! Currently we are preparing a new release of RGB \(still not the 'production' one\), so some things may work not in a totally smooth way._
