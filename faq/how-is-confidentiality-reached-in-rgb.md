# How is confidentiality reached in RGB?

1. Data is known only to owners, not to the whole world
2. Amounts are confidential with Pedersen commitments and Bulletproofs, combining best from Liquid & Grin/Mimblewimble
3. Merklization and partial data reveal keeps a lot of past history private even from future owners
4. No RGB-specific data can be extracted from Bitcoin blockchain or Lightning channel transactions
