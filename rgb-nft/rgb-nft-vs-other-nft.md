# RGB NFT vs other NFT

* no need in costly blockchain storage
* no need in IPFS \(which is also unencrypted\)
* no need in special data management solution
* no need in trusting websites to keep the data
* embedded DRM-type encryption and ownership management
* infrastructure for backups utilizing Lightning Network
* ways to monetize content \(sell not the NFT itself, but access to the content, multiple times\)
