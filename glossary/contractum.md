# Contractum

**Contractum** - planned high-level language, using which one would be able to write program RGB [Schemas](schema-and-scripts/schema.md) & AluVM \(Arithmetical logic unit virtual machine\), thus simplifying writing RGB smart contracts. In the RGB release that is currently being prepared, one can create pretty simple smart contracts in RGB \(using Rust for example\) or using Assembly for the AluVM and schema programming, which is a rather complex task for many developers. Thus, we came up with an idea to create a more high-level language that will simplify this.   
  
The prototype and current R&D results on the topic can be found in [contractum-lang repository](https://github.com/rgb-org/contractum-lang) on RGB GitHub organisation.
