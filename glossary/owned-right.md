# Owned right

**Owned right** is a particular right \(abstract concept\); for instance in fungible assets these rights are:

* asset ownership
* inflation
* renomination
* burn epoch creation
* burn / burn-and-replace operation

An owned right may have some **state** data attached. Some rights do not have state data, and this called **“declarative”** \(or “Void” previously\). Also, an owned right is always attached \(we call that **“assigned”**\) to a specific UTXO.
