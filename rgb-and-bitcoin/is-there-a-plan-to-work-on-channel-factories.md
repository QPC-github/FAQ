# Is there a plan to work on channel factories?

As a part of Lightning implementation we do have the channel factories - the [LNP Core Library](https://github.com/LNP-BP/lnp-core) will implement them. In fact, in our works we call them 'multipeer' or 'multiparty' channels, as the context and scope which can be covered with them is more broad than just creating other channels.   
So yes, LNP Core supports them and they will be a part of the [LNP Node](https://github.com/LNP-BP/lnp-node) and solutions on top of that.
